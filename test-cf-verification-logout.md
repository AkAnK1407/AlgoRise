# CF Verification Logout Test

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Missing `loadFromSupabase` Function
- Added the missing `loadFromSupabase` function that was being called but not defined
- Function loads CF verification data from the `cf_handles` table in Supabase
- Handles database errors gracefully and falls back to localStorage if needed

### 2. Enhanced `setVerificationData` Function
- Updated to save verification data to both localStorage and Supabase
- Automatically syncs with Supabase when user is logged in
- Maintains backward compatibility with localStorage-only usage

### 3. Improved `clearVerification` Function
- Now clears data from both localStorage and Supabase
- Removes CF handle record from database when user is logged in
- Properly handles database errors

### 4. Enhanced Auth Context Logout
- Modified `signOut` function to clear CF verification data from localStorage
- Ensures clean logout by removing verification data before signing out

### 5. Improved User State Synchronization
- When user logs out: CF verification data is cleared from both localStorage and context
- When user logs in: CF verification data is loaded from Supabase first, then localStorage as fallback
- Automatic sync between localStorage and Supabase for logged-in users

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Logout Flow:
1. User clicks logout
2. CF verification data is cleared from localStorage
3. User is signed out from Supabase
4. CF verification context state is reset to unverified
5. User is redirected to home page

### Login Flow:
1. User logs in with same credentials
2. CF verification context loads data from Supabase `cf_handles` table
3. If data exists in Supabase, user sees their verified status
4. If no data in Supabase, falls back to localStorage (for backward compatibility)
5. User's CF verification status is properly restored

## Test Steps

### Test 1: Logout Clears CF Verification
1. Login to the app
2. Complete CF verification process
3. Verify you see "CF verified" status in UI
4. Logout from the app
5. ✅ Expected: CF verification status should be cleared

### Test 2: Login Restores CF Verification  
1. Login with the same account that was previously verified
2. ✅ Expected: CF verification status should be restored from Supabase
3. ✅ Expected: All CF-related UI should show verified state

### Test 3: Cross-Browser/Tab Sync
1. Login and verify CF in one browser/tab
2. Open another browser/tab with same account
3. ✅ Expected: CF verification should sync across tabs
4. Logout from one tab
5. ✅ Expected: Other tabs should also show logged out state

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- CF handles are stored in the cf_handles table
CREATE TABLE cf_handles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  handle TEXT NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER,
  max_rating INTEGER,
  rank TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Key Functions Added/Modified

1. **`loadFromSupabase()`** - Loads CF verification from database
2. **`saveToSupabase()`** - Saves CF verification to database  
3. **`clearVerification()`** - Clears from both localStorage and database
4. **`setVerificationData()`** - Enhanced to sync with database
5. **`signOut()`** - Enhanced to clear CF verification data

### Data Flow
```
Login → Load from Supabase → Update Context → Show Verified UI
Verify CF → Save to both localStorage & Supabase → Update Context
Logout → Clear localStorage → Clear Context → Redirect Home
```

This fix ensures that CF verification state is properly managed across user sessions and maintains data persistence in the database while providing immediate local state updates.
