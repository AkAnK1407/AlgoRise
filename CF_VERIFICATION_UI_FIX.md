# Codeforces Verification Dialog UI Fix

## Issue Fixed
- Removed duplicate/extra close button (X) from the Codeforces verification dialog
- The dialog component already has a built-in close button, so the additional manual close button was redundant

## Changes Made

### File: `components/auth/cf-verification-dialog.tsx`

1. **Removed extra close button**:
   - Removed the manual Button component with X icon
   - Simplified the DialogHeader structure
   - Kept only the DialogTitle

2. **Cleaned up imports**:
   - Removed unused `X` icon import from lucide-react

## Before:
- Dialog had two close buttons (built-in + manual)
- Confusing UX with duplicate functionality

## After:
- Clean dialog with single close button (built-in)
- Better user experience
- Cleaner code structure

## Testing:
- Server automatically recompiled the changes
- UI should now show a clean dialog without the extra X button
